# ChatMate 🤖🔗  
### AI-Powered Web3 Virtual Assistant on Solana

ChatMate is an **AI-native virtual assistant** integrated with **Solana** that allows users to automate communication, scheduling, and services — while **owning their identity, permissions, and payments through their wallet**.

Unlike traditional AI assistants, ChatMate is **wallet-first, permission-controlled, and payment-enabled**, making it a true **AI-integrated decentralized application (dApp)**.

---

## 🚀 Why ChatMate?

Modern AI assistants can act on behalf of users — sending messages, scheduling meetings, posting content — but they lack:
- User ownership
- Verifiable permissions
- Native payments
- Privacy guarantees

**ChatMate solves this by using Solana as the trust layer.**

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🔐 Wallet & NFC-Based Login
- Login using Solana wallets (Phantom / Solflare)
- Optional NFC-based deep-link login
- No email, no passwords
- Wallet = decentralized identity

---

### 🤖 AI-Powered Automation
ChatMate can:
- Send WhatsApp & LinkedIn messages
- Schedule meetings
- Answer questions about people, tasks, and events
- Automate recurring actions (future scope)

AI interprets user intent and executes actions **only after verifying on-chain permissions**.

---

### 🔗 On-Chain Permission Control (Solana)
Users control what ChatMate is allowed to do.

Permissions include:
- Message sending
- Meeting scheduling
- Automation limits
- Paid access control

Permissions are stored and verified via Solana, ensuring:
- User ownership
- Verifiable authorization
- No silent AI actions

---

### 💳 Wallet-Native Crypto Payments
ChatMate enables **direct crypto payments** inside the app.

Use cases:
- Pay-to-connect with tutors, mentors, or professionals
- Book sessions or consultations
- Unlock premium AI-assisted services

Supported:
- SOL
- USDC (SPL Token)

No Web2 payment gateways required.

---

### 🎓 Pay-to-Connect Example
1. User searches for a Web3 tutor
2. ChatMate AI finds the profile
3. Wallet prompts payment
4. Payment is verified on Solana
5. Chat access or meeting is unlocked

Payments are **AI-orchestrated and wallet-native**.

---

### 🧾 On-Chain Payment Proofs
- Only transaction hashes are stored on-chain
- No private messages or user data
- Enables verifiable proof of service

---

### 🗂️ Encrypted Decentralized User Data
- User data is encrypted using wallet public keys
- Stored on decentralized storage (IPFS / similar)
- ChatMate cannot access data without wallet authorization

On-chain:
- Wallet → Encrypted data pointer (CID)

---

### 🪪 Optional Session NFT (MVP Extension)
- Non-transferable (Soulbound) NFT
- Represents:
  - Paid session access
  - Service entitlement
  - Time-limited permissions
